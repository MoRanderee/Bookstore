# Bookstore DB Project

Description:
This project displays my practical knowledge of using a SQL database (DB).
First, a DB is created if one does not already exist.
The DB then stores a range of books that are input by the user.
The user can view, insert, delete or edit records as needed. 

Installation:
Download the files and open using any IDE suitable for Python.

Usage:
The code of this project can be used to setup a DB and store any data required.
The user can even replicate this code to manipulate their DB.
